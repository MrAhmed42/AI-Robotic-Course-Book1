# Assessments

Student performance will be evaluated through a combination of programming projects, simulation implementations, and the final Capstone.

| Assessment | Focus | Weight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROS 2 Package Development** | Demonstrates mastery of ROS 2 architecture (Nodes, Topics, Services). | 20% |
| **Gazebo Simulation Implementation** | Requires setting up a robot (URDF), integrating sensors, and running a basic control loop within a virtual environment. | 20% |
| **Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline** | Implementation of a GPU-accelerated perception stack using Isaac ROS (VSLAM, Nvblox) on the Jetson Edge Kit. | 30% |
| **Capstone Project: Conversational AI Humanoid** | The final simulated project, integrating all components (VLA, Planning, Navigation, Vision) to execute a natural language command. | 30% |
