# Capstone Description: Autonomous Humanoid

This capstone project focuses on building an **Autonomous Humanoid** capable of performing complex tasks through a sequence of integrated AI and robotics modules.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **Voice Command Interface**: The humanoid will interpret natural language voice commands to understand high-level objectives.
*   **Intelligent Planning**: An LLM-based planning module will translate voice commands into a sequence of executable robotic actions.
*   **Autonomous Navigation**: The humanoid will navigate its environment to reach target locations.
*   **Computer Vision**: Vision systems will enable object detection, recognition, and scene understanding.
*   **Precision Manipulation**: Robotic manipulators will interact with objects in the environment to perform tasks.

**Scope**:
This implementation is **simulated-only**, developed within the hackathon scope to demonstrate the conceptual integration and functionality of the various modules in a virtual environment.
