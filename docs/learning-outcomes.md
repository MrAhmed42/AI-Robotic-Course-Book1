# Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* **Understand Physical AI Principles:** Grasp the concepts of embodied intelligence, the sim-to-real gap, and the challenges of deploying AI in physical space.
* **Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System):** Implement core robotic control systems using the ROS 2 architecture (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions).
* **Simulate Robotics:** Set up and configure complex robot simulations using **Gazebo** and **Unity**, including defining robot geometry with URDF/SDF.
* **Develop with NVIDIA Isaac:** Utilize the **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** for synthetic data generation and the **Isaac ROS** stack for hardware-accelerated perception (VSLAM, 3D Reconstruction).
* **Design Humanoid Systems:** Apply knowledge of kinematics, bipedal locomotion, and balance control for humanoid movement.
* **Integrate GPT Models:** Architect a conversational robotics system by integrating **OpenAI Whisper** and **LLMs** for natural language understanding and cognitive planning.
