# Weekly Breakdown

The course is structured over 13 weeks, ensuring a steady progression from core concepts to the complex Capstone Project.

| Weeks | Topic | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weeks 1-2** | **Introduction to Physical AI** | Foundations of embodied intelligence, the humanoid landscape, and an overview of sensor systems (LIDAR, Cameras, IMUs). |
| **Weeks 3-5** | **ROS 2 Fundamentals** | Deep dive into ROS 2 architecture: building packages with Python (`rclpy`), understanding core communication mechanisms (Nodes, Topics), and using launch files. |
| **Weeks 6-7** | **Robot Simulation** | Setting up simulation environments using **Gazebo** and **Unity**. Defining robot structure with URDF/SDF and understanding physics and sensor simulation. |
| **Weeks 8-10** | **NVIDIA Isaac Platform** | Using **Isaac SDK, Isaac Sim, and Isaac ROS**. Focus on AI-powered perception (VSLAM), manipulation, reinforcement learning, and sim-to-real transfer. |
| **Weeks 11-12** | **Humanoid Robot Development** | Kinematics, dynamics, **bipedal locomotion**, and balance control. Designing natural and safe human-robot interaction. |
| **Week 13** | **Conversational Robotics** | **VLA Integration**: Connecting **GPT models** for planning and **Whisper** for speech recognition, achieving multimodal interaction (speech, gesture, vision). |
