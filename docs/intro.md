# 🤖 Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the future of embodied intelligence. This technical guide serves as your comprehensive roadmap for bridging the gap between the **digital brain** and the **physical body**.

## 🎯 Course Vision
The future of Artificial Intelligence extends beyond digital interfaces into the physical world. This course focuses on **Physical AI**—systems that function in reality, comprehend physical laws, and interact naturally with human environments.

> **Goal:** Apply advanced AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in high-fidelity simulated environments and deploy them to real-world edge hardware.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The curriculum is divided into four core pillars, taking you from middleware fundamentals to advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.

| Module | Focus | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Robotic Nervous System** | Middleware & Control | ROS 2, Python, URDF |
| **2. Digital Twin** | Physics & Simulation | Gazebo, Unity, LiDAR/IMU |
| **3. AI-Robot Brain** | Perception & Navigation | NVIDIA Isaac Sim, VSLAM, Nav2 |
| **4. Cognitive Planning** | Conversational Robotics | VLA Models, Whisper, LLMs |

## 🛠️ Hardware Ecosystem
This course is computationally demanding. It sits at the intersection of **Physics Simulation**, **Visual Perception**, and **Generative AI**. To succeed, students will work with two primary environments:

### 1. The Digital Twin (Workstation)
High-performance "Sim-Rigs" powered by **NVIDIA RTX GPUs** (minimum 12GB VRAM). These machines run photorealistic simulations in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and manage the training of LLM-based planners.

### 2. The Physical AI Edge Kit
The "nervous system" of our robots, powered by the **NVIDIA Jetson Orin** platform. This allows for real-time inference, Computer Vision via **Intel RealSense**, and voice-to-action processing.

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this technical track, you will be able to:
* **Master ROS 2** for sophisticated robotic control and node communication.
* **Architect Digital Twins** using Gazebo and Unity for safe testing.
* **Deploy NVIDIA Isaac AI** for hardware-accelerated VSLAM and perception.
* **Integrate LLMs** to translate natural language commands (e.g., *"Clean the room"*) into autonomous robotic actions.
