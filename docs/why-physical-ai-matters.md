# Why Physical AI Matters

**Physical AI** represents a crucial evolution in artificial intelligence, moving models from being confined to digital servers to becoming **embodied intelligence** operating in the real, physical world. This transition is fundamental for the future of robotics.

### The Shift to Embodied Intelligence

Humanoid robots are uniquely positioned to excel in our human-centered world because they **share our physical form** and can interact with tools, environments, and objects built for human hands and stature.

* **Human-Centric Environments:** Our homes, factories, and offices are designed for bipedal navigation and bimanual manipulation. A robot that shares this physical form has a built-in advantage.
* **Abundant Training Data:** Human-level interaction provides an enormous, untapped source of data. By allowing robots to learn from our world, we can leverage the massive datasets generated by human interaction.

This course focuses on building systems that understand not just **language** or **vision**, but the **physical laws** (kinematics, dynamics, gravity) that govern real-world interaction.
